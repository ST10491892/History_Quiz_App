Historical Insights
 Purpose of the app 
The purpose of Historical Insights is designed to assist users to study and review historical events, dates, and figures in an engaging and interactive way. The app features a range of quizzes that tests user’s knowledge and understanding of historical periods and events (Lacombe, 2022). By using Historical Insights, users can reinforce their learning, identify areas for improvement, and develop a deeper appreciationfor history
Design considerations
Simplicity: Historical Insights is at its simplest form. Just simply press “Start”, answer true or false to the questions that appear, click next view more questions and that’s it. You will also be able to review the questions you have answered by pressing “Review” and that’s it.
Consistency: The Image used in the background, will remain the same throughout the app’s usage. Same applies to the buttons, they will remain the same colour. The font used in the app will also remain the same, whether it is the name of the app, the buttons, or it is the written text view
Readability: I have ensured that the buttons of the app are big and clear as well as the name of the app, the questions asked in the quiz screen and the score written at the end of the quiz. The feedback for answering the quiz might be small but is visible due to the background of the text view.
Feedback: Every button that the user clicks on the app will guarantee a response to what they have clicked. Pressing the “Start” button will take them directly to the quiz screen where the questions will appear. Once the user has responded with either “True” or “False”, the app will let them know whether the answer is correct or incorrect and to go to the next question, they just simply press “Next”. After all the questions have been answered and the user presses next, it will take them to the score screen where they will be shown the number of questions gotten correctly. By pressing “Review” the app will show the user which questions they got correctly and/or incorrectly and finally by pressing “Exit”, the app will close. 
Design for thumbs: I have made it possible for users to use one hand, and not even two fingers. With only your thumb, you will be able to navigate your way around the app
